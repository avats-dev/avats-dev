### Welcome to my github profile. 
#### (FYI, I'm a newbie!) ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergrad :man_student: student at [IIITDM Jabalpur](https://www.iiitdmj.ac.in/) pursuing B.Tech. I'm interested in the domain of artificial intelligence *(:scientist: not the hyped and fictional one!!)*. I'm fluent in python and C++. I also do competitive coding sometimes to enhance my data structures and algorithms. I also contribute to :vulcan_salute: open source in my free time. Apart this, I love to read novels, and :star_struck:	watch movies and shows.
