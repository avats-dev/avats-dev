## Hey ðŸ‘‹ ! Welcome to my codebase, let's fix some bugs.

I'm an undergrad student :man_student: at [IIITDM Jabalpur](https://www.iiitdmj.ac.in/) pursuing B.Tech. 
- I'm interested in studying AI and implementing deep learning methods to social issues. 
- I'm fluent in python and C++. I also do competitive coding sometimes. 
- I contribute to open source whenever I can. 
- Apart from this, I love to read novels, and watch movies and shows :star_struck:.

Feel free to reach out if you want to do research on any deep learning paradigms together or you have a nice project idea to implement. I am always open for discussions on deep learning papers and science fiction(specially time travel).
