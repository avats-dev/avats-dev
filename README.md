## Welcome to my codebase, let's fix some bugs. :wave:

I'm an undergrad student :man_student: at [IIITDM Jabalpur](https://www.iiitdmj.ac.in/) pursuing B.Tech. I'm interested in the domain of artificial intelligence. I'm fluent in python and C++. I also do competitive coding sometimes. I contribute to open source in whenever I can. Apart from this, I love to read novels, and :star_struck: watch movies and shows.
